            "Today,information architecture(IA) is a recognized term in many technology, product, and Web-design organizations. However, in many other organizations, information architecture is still “the pain with no name.” [1] If you ask senior practitioners of information architecture, they’ll tell you that information architecture is central to the creation of human-computer interfaces. But the fact of the matter is that the popular view of information architecture represents just a very small subset of its total value.\n",
            "In this column, I’ll first summarize the popular conception of the practice of information architecture, then I’ll highlight the broader scope of the practice that still remains to be realized.\n",
            "For more than two decades, information-architecture pioneers, passionate thought leaders, and pundits have argued the merits of information architecture. The popular conception of the scope of information architecture has derived from the writings of Peter Morville and Lou Rosenfeld, who have defined the core components of information architecture, as follows:\n",
            "In defining a simple summary of any complex domain, there is the risk of trivializing what you’re trying to explain. Case in point: There have now been four editions of Morville and Rosenfeld’s book,Information Architecture for the World Wide Web, which explores the scope of these four components in detail. However, senior advocates and practitioners of information architecture still struggle to communicate more than just the first word in each of these  component names.\n",
            "For all intents and purposes, organizations have failed to adopt search as an information-architecture practice. Search platforms and artificial intelligence crowd this space. When a project team limits the definition ofinformation architectureto navigation, content organization, and labeling—and not their respective systems—it’s all too easy for individuals to view the practice of information architecture as a cross-disciplinary effort. Even UX professionals, content strategists, technologists, and business stakeholders with only moderate information-architecture skills seem to be comfortable in rationalizing an information architecture.\n",
            "As a consequence, we hear phrases like: “Everyone is doing information architecture.” And “Everyone is an information architect.” And these are actually expressions that leading IA practitioners have coined!\n",
            "If, in theory, it’s true that everyoneisdoing information architecture andisan information architect, it’s just as true to say we’re all designers, artists, poets, and scientists. The risk with these sorts of statements is that they are abstract generalizations that encompass only the simplest use cases of more complex problem spaces. And they resonate only with those who have a limited conception of those spaces.\n",
            "It’s actually the second word in  each of those  component names that embodies the complexity and essence of information-architecture practice. Fortunately, there is just one word we need to consider in making this point:systems. Since 1998, the wordsystemhas persisted in the vernacular of information-architecture academics, practitioners, and independent researchers—and always in close relationship with the concepts of navigation systems, organization systems, labeling systems, and search systems.\n",
            "Words have specific meanings in specific contexts. In relation to information architecture, the wordsystemsdoesnotimplytechnology systems. Rather, the use of the wordsystemrefers to the underlying ecological nature of an information environment, or space. Therefore, while the first word in each component name  suggests an output, we should never take those words out of the context of their related information-architecture system. This is where the true scope of information architecture rests.\n",
            "In theory, every user-interface design has an information architecture that underpins it. In practice, no information architecture exists without arepresentationof the system in question. This means, unless you have modeled the domain, or system, that an information architecture attempts to reflect, you havenotreally provided an information architecture.\n"
